## Contributor Code of Conduct
By contributing you agree to respect the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/newcon/securitytools/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of this repository.

## In a nutshell
1. "A link to easily download the tool" is not always a link to *download* the tool. Please only contribute after validating the link as well as the tool.
2. You don't have to know git: if you found something of interest which is *not already in this repo*, please open an issue with your links propositions.
    - If you know git, please fork the repo and send pull requests.
3. We have 3 kinds of tools listed within categories. Choose the right one:

    - **Open Source**: All the open source tools. Here's a link for the reference [Open Source](https://opensource.org/).
    - **Free and closed source**: All the free tools are not open source. Please validate before adding to the list. Here's a link for the reference [difference between free and open source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html).
    - **Paid**: All those tools that need to be bought or are paid for use.

4. Make sure to follow the [guidelines below](#guidelines) and respect the [formatting](#formatting) of the files.

### Formatting
- All lists are `.md` files. Try to learn [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) syntax. It's simple!
- All the lists start with an Index. The idea is to list and link all sections and subsections there. Keep it in alphabetical order.
- Sections are using level 3 headings (`###`), and subsections are level 4 headings (`####`).
